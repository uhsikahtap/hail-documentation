## Experimental


This module serves two functions: as a staging area for extensions of Hail not
ready for inclusion in the main package, and as a library of lightly reviewed
community submissions.

At present, the experimental module is organized into a few freestanding
modules, linked immediately below, and many freestanding functions, documented
on this page.

Warning

The functionality in this module may change or disappear entirely between
different versions of Hail. If you critically depend on functionality in this
module, please create an issue to request promotion of that functionality to
non-experimental. Otherwise, that functionality may disappear!
